# SVR-MachineLearning
Machine Learning Notebook focusing on Support Vector regression package from Sklearn
This file was created as an assignment for machine learning at the University of Calgary. This file explores how to use SVM.svr from the package Sklearn within python. We will
use the breastcancer data from Sklearn to test this regressor. Enjoy!
